       suggest that dark matter in the form of dense antimatter
       nuggets could provide a natural site for electron and proton
       annihilation, providing 511 {keV} photons, gamma-rays, and
       diffuse {keV} X-ray radiation.  We show that identifying dark
       matter as antimatter nuggets is consistent with the observed

       identifies dark matter and explains baryogenesis, but allows

                 the great clusters of galaxies are held together by the
                 gravitational force of unseen (dark) matter. Today, the
                 case is stronger and more precise: Dark, nonbaryonic
                 matter accounts for {$30\% \pm 7\%$} of the critical mass
                 density, with baryons (most of which are dark)
                 contributing only {$4.5\% \pm 0.5\%$} of the critical
                 density. The large-scale structure that exists in the
                 Universe indicates that the bulk of the nonbaryonic
                 dark matter must be cold (slowly moving particles). The
                 SuperKamiokande detection of neutrino oscillations
                 shows that particle dark matter exists, crossing an
                 important threshold. Over the past few years a case has
                 developed for a dark-energy problem. This dark
                 component contributes about {$80\% \pm 20\%$} of the critical
                 density and is characterized by very negative pressure
                 {$(p_X < -0.6 \rho_X)$}. Consistent with this picture of
                 dark energy and dark matter are measurements of {CMB}
                 anisotropy that indicate that total contribution of
                 matter and energy is within {$10\%$} of the critical
                 density. Fundamental physics beyond the standard model
                 is implicated in both the dark matter and dark energy
                 puzzles: new fundamental particles (e.g., axion or
                 neutralino) and new forms of relativistic energy (e.g.,
                 vacuum energy or a light scalar field). A flood of
                 observations will shed light on the dark side of the
                 Universe over the next two decades; as it does it will
                 advance our understanding of the Universe and the laws

Quantum transport is conveniently studied in a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) because of the combination of a large Fermi wavelength and large mean free path. Semiconductor nanostructures are unique in offering the possibility of studying quantum transport in an artificial potential landscape. This is the regime of ballistic transport in which scattering with impurities are neglected. The chapter presents a self-contained account of these three novel transport regimes in semiconductor nanostructures. The study of quantum transport in semiconductor nanostructures is motivated by more than scientific interest. The fabrication of nanostructures relies on sophisticated crystal growth and lithographic techniques that exist because of the industrial effort toward the miniaturization of transistors. Conventional transistors operate in the regime of classical diffusive transport, which breaks down on short length scales. The discovery of novel transport regimes in semiconductor nanostructures provides options for the development of innovative future devices.}

The question can be asked a different way, however: ``How small do we have to make devices in order to get fundamentally new properties?'' By ``new properties'' we particularly mean those that arise from quantum mechanics or the quantization of charge in units of eeffects that are only important in small systems such as atoms. ``What kind of small electronic devices do we have in mind?'' Any sort of clustering of atoms that can be connected to source and drain contacts and whose properties can be regulated with a gate electrode. Practically, the clustering of atoms may be a molecule, a small grain of metallic atoms, or an electronic device that is made with modern chip fabrication techniques. It turns out that such seemingly different structures have quite similar transport properties and that one can explain their physics within one relatively simple framework. In this paper we investigate the physics of electron transport through such small systems.",

Additionally, the devices with Schottky gates exhibit drift over time toward lower conductance, while the devices with the dielectric drift toward higher conductance. Temperature-dependent measurements suggest that in devices with Schottky gates, noise is dominated by tunneling from the gates to trap sites in the semiconductor, and when this mechanism is suppressed by inclusion of a dielectric, thermally activated hopping between trap sites becomes the dominant source of noise.}",

abstract = {We use time-resolved charge detection techniques to investigate single-electron tunneling in semiconductor quantum dots. The ability to detect individual charges in real-time makes it possible to count electrons one-by-one as they pass through the structure. The setup can thus be used as a high-precision current meter for measuring ultra-low currents, with resolution several orders of magnitude better than that of conventional current meters. In addition to measuring the average current, the counting procedure also makes it possible to investigate correlations between charge carriers. Electron correlations are conventionally probed in noise measurements, which are technically challenging due to the difficulty to exclude the influence of external noise sources in the experimental setup. Using real-time charge detection techniques, we circumvent the problem by studying the electron correlation directly from the counting statistics of the tunneling electrons. In quantum dots, we find that the strong Coulomb interaction makes electrons try to avoid each other. This leads to electron anti-bunching, giving stronger correlations and reduced noise compared to a current carried by statistically independent electrons. The charge detector is implemented by monitoring changes in conductance in a nearby capacitively coupled quantum point contact. We find that the quantum point contact not only serves as a detector but also causes a back-action onto the measured device. Electron scattering in the quantum point contact leads to emission of microwave radiation. The radiation is found to induce an electronic transition between two quantum dots, similar to the absorption of light in real atoms and molecules. Using a charge detector to probe the electron transitions, we can relate a single-electron tunneling event to the absorption of a single photon. Moreover, since the energy levels of the double quantum dot can be tuned by external gate voltages, we use the device as a frequency-selective single-photon detector operating at microwave energies. The ability to put an on-chip microwave detector close to a quantum conductor opens up the possibility to investigate radiation emitted from mesoscopic structures and gives a deeper understanding of the role of electron–photon interactions in quantum conductors. A central concept of quantum mechanics is the wave–particle duality; matter exhibits both wave- and particle-like properties and cannot be described by either formalism alone. To investigate the wave properties of the electrons, we perform experiments on a structure containing a double quantum dot embedded in the Aharonov–Bohm ring interferometer. Aharonov–Bohm rings are traditionally used to study interference of electron waves traversing different arms of the ring, in a similar way to the double-slit setup used for investigating interference of light waves. In our case, we use the time-resolved charge detection techniques to detect electrons one-by-one as they pass through the interferometer. We find that the individual particles indeed self-interfere and give rise to a strong interference pattern as a function of external magnetic field. The high level of control in the system together with the ability to detect single electrons enables us to make direct observations of non-intuitive fundamental quantum phenomena like single-particle interference or time–energy uncertainty relations.}

Because of the dynamical character of the localized spin system, the Pauli principle should be taken into account in the intermediate states of the second order terms. Thus the effect of the Fermi sphere is involved in the scattering probability and gives rise to a singular term in the resistivity which involves c log T as a factor, where c is the concentration of impurity atoms. When combined with the lattice resistivity, this gives rise to a resistance minimum, provided the s-d exchange integral J is negative. The temperature at which the minimum ccurs is proportional to c1/5 and the depth of the minimum to c, as is observed. The predicted log T dependence is tested with available experiments and is confirmed. The value of J to have fit with experiments is about -0.2 ev, which is of reasonable magnitude. Our conclusion is that J should be negative in alloys which show a resistance minimum. It is argued that the resistance minimum is a result of the sharp Fermi surface.}",

The Coulomb blockade for electron tunneling is overcome completely by the Kondo effect, and the conductance reaches the unitary limit value. We compare the experimental Kondo temperature with the theoretical predictions for the spin-½ Anderson impurity model. Excellent agreement is found throughout the Kondo regime. Phase coherence is preserved when a Kondo quantum dot is included in one of the arms of an Aharonov-Bohm ring structure, and the phase behavior differs from previous results on a non-Kondo dot.}}

	Abstract = {Image projection relies on classical wave mechanics and the use of natural or engineered structures such as lenses or resonant cavities. Well-known examples include the bending of light to create mirages in the atmosphere, and the focusing of sound by whispering galleries. However, the observation of analogous phenomena in condensed matter systems is a more recent development, facilitated by advances in nanofabrication. Here we report the projection of the electronic structure surrounding a magnetic Co atom to a remote location on the surface of a Cu crystal; electron partial waves scattered from the real Co atom are coherently refocused to form a spectral image or 'quantum mirage'. The focusing device is an elliptical quantum corral, assembled on the Cu surface. The corral acts as a quantum mechanical resonator, while the two-dimensional Cu surface-state electrons form the projection medium. When placed on the surface, Co atoms display a distinctive spectroscopic signature, known as the many-particle Kondo resonance, which arises from their magnetic moment. By positioning a Co atom at one focus of the ellipse, we detect a strong Kondo signature not only at the atom, but also at the empty focus. This behaviour contrasts with the usual spatially-decreasing response of an electron gas to a localized perturbation.},

However, the spectral weight of such resonance is reduced leading to an observable suppression of the conductance and the elastic transmission probability through the QD.}
