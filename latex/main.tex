%************************************************
% Optional packages.
%
% The use of these packages is optional, but they provide various
% tools for more flexible formating.  The sample thesis uses these,
% but if you remove the example code, you should be able to exclude
% these packages.  Only standard packages have been described here;
% they should be installed with any complete LaTeX instalation, but
% if not, you can find them at the Comprehensive TeX Archive Network
% (CTAN): http://www.ctan.org/
%

%******** afterpage ***************************
% This package allows you to issue commands at the end of the current
% page.  A good use for this is to use the command
% \afterpage{\clearpage} right after a figure.  This will cause the
% figure to be inserted on the page following the current one (or on
% the current page if it will fit) but will not break the page in the
% middle.
\usepackage{afterpage}

%******** float *********************************
% This package allows you to customize the style of
% "floats"---floating objects such as figures and tables.  In
% addition, it allows you to define additional floating objects which
% may be included in a list similar to that produces by \listoftables
% and \listoffigures.  Common uses include introducing floats for
% programs and other code bits in Compute Science and Chemical Schema.
\usepackage{float}

%******** tocloft *******************************
% This package allows you to customize and define custom lists such
% as a list of programs or Chemical Scheme.  Note: if you use the
% subfigure package, you must specify that you do as an option here.
% The title option uses the default formatting.  We do not use this
% here as the default formatting is acceptable.  Use the float
% package instead unless you need the extra formatting control
% provided by tocloft.
%\usepackage[subfigure, titles]{tocloft}

%******** alltt *********************************
% The alltt package allows you to include files and have them
% formatted in a verbatim fashion.  This is useful for including
% source code from an additional file.
%\usepackage{alltt}

%******** listings ******************************
% The listings package may be used to include chunks of source code
% and has facilities for pretty-printing many languages.
%\usepackage{listings}

%******** longtable *****************************
% The longtable package allows you to define tables that span
% multiple pages.
\usepackage{longtable}

%******** graphics and graphicx *****************
% This allows you to include encapsulated postscript files.  If you
% don't have this, comment the \includegraphics{} line following the
% comment "%includegraphics" later in this file.
\usepackage{graphicx}

%******** subfigure *****************************
% The subfigure package allows you to include multiple figures and
% captions within a single figure environment.
%\usepackage{subfigure}

%******** here **********************************
% The here package gives you more control over the placement of
% figures and tables.  In particular, you can specify the placement
% "H" which means "Put the figure here" rather than [h] which means
% "I would suggest that you put the figure here if you think it looks
% good."
%\usepackage{here}

%******** pdflscape ********************************
% This allows you to include landscape layout pages by using the
% |landscape| environment.  The use of |pdflscape| is preferred over
% the standard |lscape| package because it automatically rotates the
% page in the pdf file for easier reading.  (Thanks to Joseph Shea
% for pointing this out.)
\usepackage{pdflscape}

%******** natbib ********************************
% This is a very nice package for bibliographies.  It includes options
% for sorting and compressing bibliographic entries.
\usepackage[numbers,sort&compress]{natbib}

%******** psfrag ******************************
% This allows you to replace text in postscript pictures with formated
% latex text.  This allows you to use math in graph labels
% etc. Uncomment the psfrag lines following the "%psfrag" comment
% later in this file if you don't have this package.  The replacements
% will only be visible in the final postscript file: they will be
% listed in the .dvi file but not performed.
\usepackage{psfrag}

%******** hyperref *****************************
% Please read the manual:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/hyperref/manual.html
%
% This adds hyperlinks to your document: with the right viewers (later
% versions of xdvi, acrobat with pdftex, latex2html etc.) this will
% make your equation, figure, citation references etc. hyperlinks so
% that you can click on them.  Also, your table of contents will be
% able to take you to the appropriate sections.  In the viewers that
% support this, the links often appear with an underscore.  This
% underscore will not appear in printed versions.
%
% Note: if you do not use the hypertex option, then the dvips driver
% may be loaded by default.  This will cause the entries in the list
% of figures and list of tables to be on a single line because dvips
% does not deal with hyperlinks on broken lines properly.
%
% NOTE: HYPERREF is sensitive to the ORDER in which it is LOADED.
% For example, it must be loaded AFTER natbib but BEFORE newly
% defined float environments.  See the README file with the hyperref
% for some help with this.  If you have some very obscure errors, try
% first disabling hyperref.  If that fixes the problem, try various
% orderings.
%
% Note also that there is a bug with versions before 2003/11/30
% v6.74m that cause the float package to not function correctly.
% Please ensure you have a current version of this package.  A
% warning will be issued if you leave the date below but do not have
% a current version installed.
%
% Some notes on options: depending on how you build your files, you
% may need to choose the appropriate option (such as [pdftex]) for the
% backend driver (see the hyperref manual for a complete list).  Also,
% the default here is to make links from the page numbers in the table
% of contents and lists of figures etc.  There are other options:
% excluding the [linktocpage] option will make the entire text a
% hyperref, but for some backends will prevent the text from wrapping
% which can look terrible.  There is a [breaklinks=true] option that
% will be set if the backend supports (dvipdfm for example supports
% it but does not work with psfrag.)
%
% Finally, there are many options for choosing the colours of the
% links.  These will be included by default in future versions but
% you should probably consider changing some now for the electronic
% version of your thesis.

\chapter{Lay Summary}

[Required, Maximum 150 words]

This is a simple summary of your thesis, written so that members of the public will get some idea about what you have done. 

\chapter{Preface} % Manditory if any of the conditions are met

You must include a preface if any part of your research was partly or
wholly published in articles, was part of a collaboration, or required
the approval of UBC Research Ethics Boards.

The Preface must include the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item A statement indicating the relative contributions of all
  collaborators and co-authors of publications (if any), emphasizing
  details of your contribution, and stating the proportion of research
  and writing conducted by you.
\item A list of any publications arising from work presented in the
  dissertation, and the chapter(s) in which the work is located.
\item The name of the particular UBC Research Ethics Board, and the
  Certificate Number(s) of the Ethics Certificate(s) obtained, if
  ethics approval was required for the research.
\end{itemize}

%%% Sections and subsections etc. in the Preface should in general
%%% not be listed in the table of contents, so use the starred form
%%% of \section etc.
\section*{Examples}



Note that this preface must come before the table of contents.  Note
also that this section ``Examples'' should not be listed in the table
of contents, so we have used the starred form: \verb|\section*{Example}|.

\tableofcontents                %% Mandatory
% \listoftables                   %% Mandatory if thesis has tables
\listoffigures                  %% Mandatory if thesis has figures
\listof{Program}{List of Programs} %% Optional
%% Any other lists should come here, i.e.
%% Abbreviation schemes, definitions, lists of formulae, list of
%% schemes, glossary, list of symbols etc.

\chapter{Acknowledgements}      %% Optional
This is the place to thank professional colleagues and people who have
given you the most help during the course of your graduate work.

\section{Programs}
Here we give an example of a new float as defined using the
\texttt{float} package.  In the preamble we have used the commands
\begin{verbatim}
\floatstyle{ruled}
\newfloat{Program}{htbp}{lop}[chapter]
\end{verbatim}
This creates a ``Program'' environment that may be used for program
fragments.  A sample \texttt{python} program is shown in
Program~\ref{prog:fib}.  (Note that Python places a fairly restrictive
limit on recursion so trying to call this with a large $n$ before
building up the cache is likely to fail unless you increase the
recursion depth.)
\begin{Program}
  \caption{\label{prog:fib} Python program that computes the $n^{\rm
      th}$ Fibonacci number using memoization.}
\begin{verbatim}
def fib(n,_cache={}):
    if n < 2:
        return 1
    if n in _cache:
        return _cache[n]
    else:
        result = fib(n-1)+fib(n-2)
        _cache[n] = result
        return result
\end{verbatim}
\end{Program}
Instead of using a \texttt{verbatim} environment for your program
chunks, you might like to \texttt{include} them within an
\texttt{alltt} envrironment by including the \verb|\usepackage{alltt}|
package (see page 187 of the \LaTeX{} book).  Another useful package
is the \verb|\usepackage{listings}| which can pretty-print many
different types of source code.

%% Here we provide a short optional argument to \chapter[]{}.  This

% \chapter[Another Chapter\ldots]{Another Chapter with a Very Long
%   Chapter-name that will Probably Cause Problems}
% \label{cha:apple_ref}

% This chapter name is very long and does not display properly in the
% running headers or in the table of contents.  To deal with this, we
% provide a shorter version of the title as the optional argument to the
% \verb|\chapter[]{}| command.

% For example, this chapter's title and associated table of contents heading and
% running header was created with\\
% \verb|\chapter[Another Chapter\ldots]{Another Chapter with a Very Long|\\
% \verb|Chapter-name that will Probably Cause Problems}|.

% Note that, according to the thesis regulations, the heading included
