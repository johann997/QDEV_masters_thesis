%******** float *********************************
% This package allows you to customize the style of
% "floats"---floating objects such as figures and tables.  In
% addition, it allows you to define additional floating objects which
% may be included in a list similar to that produces by \listoftables
% and \listoffigures.  Common uses include introducing floats for

%******** tocloft *******************************
% This package allows you to customize and define custom lists such
% as a list of programs or Chemical Scheme.  Note: if you use the
% subfigure package, you must specify that you do as an option here.
% The title option uses the default formatting.  We do not use this
% here as the default formatting is acceptable.  Use the float
% package instead unless you need the extra formatting control
% provided by tocloft.
%\usepackage[subfigure, titles]{tocloft}

%******** alltt *********************************
% The alltt package allows you to include files and have them
% formatted in a verbatim fashion.  This is useful for including
% source code from an additional file.
%\usepackage{alltt}

%******** listings ******************************
% The listings package may be used to include chunks of source code
% and has facilities for pretty-printing many languages.
%\usepackage{listings}

%******** longtable *****************************
% The longtable package allows you to define tables that span
% multiple pages.
\usepackage{longtable}

%******** graphics and graphicx *****************
% This allows you to include encapsulated postscript files.  If you
% don't have this, comment the \includegraphics{} line following the
% comment "%includegraphics" later in this file.
\usepackage{graphicx}

%******** subfigure *****************************
% The subfigure package allows you to include multiple figures and
% captions within a single figure environment.
%\usepackage{subfigure}

%******** here **********************************
% The here package gives you more control over the placement of
% figures and tables.  In particular, you can specify the placement
% "H" which means "Put the figure here" rather than [h] which means
% "I would suggest that you put the figure here if you think it looks
% good."
%\usepackage{here}

%******** pdflscape ********************************
% This allows you to include landscape layout pages by using the
% |landscape| environment.  The use of |pdflscape| is preferred over
% the standard |lscape| package because it automatically rotates the
% page in the pdf file for easier reading.  (Thanks to Joseph Shea
% for pointing this out.)

% This is a very nice package for bibliographies.  It includes options
% for sorting and compressing bibliographic entries.
% \usepackage[numbers,sort&compress]{natbib}

%******** psfrag ******************************
% This allows you to replace text in postscript pictures with formated
% latex text.  This allows you to use math in graph labels
% etc. Uncomment the psfrag lines following the "%psfrag" comment
% later in this file if you don't have this package.  The replacements
% will only be visible in the final postscript file: they will be
% listed in the .dvi file but not performed.
\usepackage{psfrag}

%******** hyperref *****************************
% Please read the manual:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/hyperref/manual.html
%
% This adds hyperlinks to your document: with the right viewers (later
% versions of xdvi, acrobat with pdftex, latex2html etc.) this will
% make your equation, figure, citation references etc. hyperlinks so
% that you can click on them.  Also, your table of contents will be
% able to take you to the appropriate sections.  In the viewers that
% support this, the links often appear with an underscore.  This
% underscore will not appear in printed versions.
%
% Note: if you do not use the hypertex option, then the dvips driver
% may be loaded by default.  This will cause the entries in the list
% of figures and list of tables to be on a single line because dvips
% does not deal with hyperlinks on broken lines properly.
%
% NOTE: HYPERREF is sensitive to the ORDER in which it is LOADED.
% For example, it must be loaded AFTER natbib but BEFORE newly
% defined float environments.  See the README file with the hyperref
% for some help with this.  If you have some very obscure errors, try
% first disabling hyperref.  If that fixes the problem, try various
% orderings.
%
% Note also that there is a bug with versions before 2003/11/30
% v6.74m that cause the float package to not function correctly.
% Please ensure you have a current version of this package.  A
% warning will be issued if you leave the date below but do not have
% a current version installed.
%
% Some notes on options: depending on how you build your files, you
% may need to choose the appropriate option (such as [pdftex]) for the
% backend driver (see the hyperref manual for a complete list).  Also,
% the default here is to make links from the page numbers in the table
% of contents and lists of figures etc.  There are other options:
% excluding the [linktocpage] option will make the entire text a
% hyperref, but for some backends will prevent the text from wrapping
% which can look terrible.  There is a [breaklinks=true] option that
% will be set if the backend supports (dvipdfm for example supports
% it but does not work with psfrag.)
%
% Finally, there are many options for choosing the colours of the
% links.  These will be included by default in future versions but
% you should probably consider changing some now for the electronic
% version of your thesis.

The Kondo effect, first discovered in impure bulk metals during the 1930s and explained in the 1960s, has gained significant interest within the field of quantum devices. 
These devices offer a high degree of tunability and control, enabling rigorous testing of theoretical predictions.
Previous studies on the Kondo effect have measured conductance through a quantum dot and observed a zero-bias peak between Coulomb peaks. 
This effect requires strong coupling between the quantum dot and leads.

This work studies a relatively weak coupling, where the characteristic zero-bias peak between Coulomb peaks is not observed. However, as charge degeneracy of the quantum dot is approached, the Kondo temperature increases. This results in a small conductance enhancement at the shoulder of the Coulomb peak. 
We show that a simultaneous measurement of the quantum dot's occupation can unveil the small enhancement of conductance due to the Kondo effect. 

To compare with Numerical Renormalisation Group (NRG) theory, conductance and occupation are measured across a range of temperatures to determine fitting parameters.
Good agreement is found at a range of coupling strengths and charge sensor current setpoints.
However, a discrepancy is found when the tunnel barriers to the quantum dot are asymmetrically tuned. 



Strong asymmetric coupling approaches a regime where the quantum dot is coupled to a single lead. 
A recent measurement of the entropy of a quantum dot coupled to a single lead where Kondo correlations were expected also observed a discrepancy between data and NRG. 
Interestingly, this work shows that conductance data displays greater Kondo enhancement than NRG, whereas previously measured entropy showed less Kondo enhancement than NRG. 
A direct comparison of conductance and entropy measured in the same device under similar settings holds promise for illuminating this discrepancy.






  
\end{abstract}

\chapter{Lay Summary} %% Mandatory -  maximum 150 words

 The Kondo effect, a phenomenon originally observed in impure metals decades ago, has been studied more recently in quantum devices. 
 These devices offer precise control to test theoretical predictions. 
 In these devices, a single electron on an isolated island is connected to a bath of electrons on each side.
 
 Previous studies have measured the conductance through the island as a single electron is added and observed a large increase in conductance as the system's temperature was lowered. 
 These experiments used a small barrier between the island and surrounding electrons. 

 
 In our experiment, we used a large barrier, resulting in an increase in conductance that was too small to measure with previous methods.
 To measure this small increase in conductance, we also measure the island's occupation as a single electron is added. 
 When the barriers to the island are symmetric, we find agreement with theory, and surprising disagreement when asymmetric. 



\chapter{Preface} % Manditory if any of the conditions are met

This thesis encompasses the research I conducted during my Master's studies in the Quantum Devices group, led by Joshua Folk, at the University of British Columbia. 

Numerous discussions with my supervisor Joshua Folk, and research associate Silvia Lüscher have greatly influenced the experimental concept, device design, analysis and interpretation. 

The GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructures were provided by Michael Manfra's group at the University of Purdue.
Christian Olsen fabricated the mesas and ohmic contacts at the University of Copenhagen.


Numerical Renormalisation Group (NRG) simulations that we compare our measurements to in Chapter~\ref{cha:mixed_valence_conductance}, were performed by Yaakov Kleeorin, under the supervision of Yigal Meir.


I joined the Quantum Devices group as an undergraduate (September 2021) and spent the first eight months shadowing Timothy Child throughout the design, fabrication, measurement, and analysis processes.

The following year (first year of my Master's studies, September 2022), I spent working closely with Timothy on device design, fabrication, and measurement. Timothy and I fabricated all devices used in this thesis during this period. All data taken in Chapter~\ref{cha:device_background} and Chapter~\ref{cha:kondo_conductance} was taken by Timothy and I. In particular, at the end of this period, Timothy and I took preliminary measurements in the regime explored in Chapter~\ref{cha:mixed_valence_conductance}. These measurements demonstrated a working proof of how to measure in this regime. 

In my final year (starting May 2023), Timothy worked on his PhD, and I became the lead researcher responsible for data collection and analysis.
All data taken in Chapter~\ref{cha:mixed_valence_conductance} was taken during this period.

All figures in this work are original.

\chapter{Acknowledgements}      %% Optional
As I write this final section of my thesis on a rainy Vancouver evening with a cup of `Belfast Brew' in hand, I can't help but reminisce on this chapter of life as it comes to an end. I have spent the last seven years at the University of British Columbia, where the last three in the Quantum Devices Group have been a particular highlight. I must start by thanking all current and former members of the group. Much work is required to study quantum dots, and none of my work would have been possible without all the effort that has been put into creating an educational and thought-provoking lab environment.


Of course, my first personal thanks goes to my supervisor, Professor Joshua Folk. Over the last three years, his ability to explain tricky concepts, patience to ensure my understanding and attention to detail has made me a better physicist. 
One of many skills that I will take with me is understanding when I do and do not understand. 

Dr. Silvia Lüscher: Much have I learnt from Silvia on mesoscopic physics and the art of fabrication. In meetings, Silvia's insights offered alternate paths to a solution. These insights were a reminder to explore all options before settling on an answer. Also, her Swiss chocolate recommendation (`Ragusa') is excellent.   

Dr. Timothy Child: A senior PhD student who was my mentor during my first year in the group. We worked together closely in my second year. Many long days were spent together being serenaded by the pulse tube. It didn't take long for us to become friends. Joined by a genuine passion for learning and adventure, our many discussions and deliberations were not only of great academic but also personal interest. I look forward to staying in touch and perhaps trying caving in Slovenia. 

Vahid Mohaved: A PhD student who joined in my final year here. Our love for coffee brought us together on many Tim Horton's trips where we discussed physics and more.  

Elena Cornick: A Ph.D. student who joined me in my final half-year here. Although we only had a short cross-over, we worked efficiently, and Elena's theoretical insights were a welcome challenge to my `tennis ball' model of electrons. 

Lily Watt: An undergraduate student who worked on perfecting our ohmic recipe. I always enjoyed the insightful questions and wish her the best as president of UBCQ.

Raveel Tejani: An undergraduate who tackled the brave task of developing `master-slave' functionality for our measuring instruments. Our lunch walks for pizza slices and discussions on climbing were enjoyable breaks from weeks of confusing measurements.  


Dr. Yigal Meir, Dr. Eran Sela, and Dr. Andrew Mitchell: Our theory collaborators for their expertise and understanding of how to translate their theoretical frameworks onto our experiments. 


Our `Quantropy' collaborators at ETH Zurich (Klauss Ensslin and Thomas Ihn's group), and Université Paris-Saclay (Frederic Pierre's group), thank you for organising the Quantropy conferences over the past three years. The wide range of disciplines and shared goals fostered fruitful conversations. Witnessing the birth and debate of new experimental ideas was remarkable.



Diego, Mason, Pearce and Luke: My best friends from University and back home in Ireland. We have all moved to different cities, but our friendships remain strong. I always look forward to our calls for fresh perspectives and annual, sometimes bi-annual, meetups for a beer or three. Whether we are discussing the details of heat pumps or walking \qty{60}{km} for a fish and chips, our adventures are always a pleasure.

Čeňka: My sister, we have grown up greatly over the past few years, although it seems that distance has brought us closer. I love all that we do together, from our debates to our dance-offs; I look forward to being closer to home in the future.

Jana and Peter: My parents, it goes without saying that you influence much of who I am. I always look forward to our weekly catchups, whether they are long or short; they keep me rooted. They say that home is where you are known the most and appreciated the least. But not in this case. You were my first educators and now my best friends.

Olivia: My fiancée and future wife. Little did I know that seven years ago, when I decided to cross the Atlantic, I would find a life partner. We are there for each other, for the big and small, the highs and lows. 
From our protein bar assembly line to our 14 hour hikes and evening tea time, who knows what our next chapter will hold. I look forward to it with eager anticipation.

%% here.  This is ensured by making the \texttt{appendicestoc} option
%% a default option to the UBC thesis class.

%%% If you only have one appendix, please uncomment the following line.
\appendix

\include{latex/chapters/appendix1}

\include{latex/chapters/appendix2}
% \chapter{First Appendix}
% Here you can have your appendices.  Note that if you only have a
% single appendix, you should issue
% \verb|\renewcommand{\appendicesname}{Appendix}| before calling
% \verb|\appendix| to display the singular ``Appendix'' rather than the
% default plural ``Appendices''.

% \chapter{Second Appendix}
% Here is the second appendix.

%% This changes the headings and chapter titles (no numbers for
%% example).
