%******** float *********************************
% This package allows you to customize the style of
% "floats"---floating objects such as figures and tables.  In
% addition, it allows you to define additional floating objects which
% may be included in a list similar to that produces by \listoftables
% and \listoffigures.  Common uses include introducing floats for
% programs and other code bits in Compute Science and Chemical Schema.

%******** tocloft *******************************
% This package allows you to customize and define custom lists such
% as a list of programs or Chemical Scheme.  Note: if you use the
% subfigure package, you must specify that you do as an option here.
% The title option uses the default formatting.  We do not use this
% here as the default formatting is acceptable.  Use the float
% package instead unless you need the extra formatting control
% provided by tocloft.
%\usepackage[subfigure, titles]{tocloft}

%******** alltt *********************************
% The alltt package allows you to include files and have them
% formatted in a verbatim fashion.  This is useful for including
% source code from an additional file.
%\usepackage{alltt}

%******** listings ******************************
% The listings package may be used to include chunks of source code
% and has facilities for pretty-printing many languages.
%\usepackage{listings}

%******** longtable *****************************
% The longtable package allows you to define tables that span
% multiple pages.
\usepackage{longtable}

%******** graphics and graphicx *****************
% This allows you to include encapsulated postscript files.  If you
% don't have this, comment the \includegraphics{} line following the
% comment "%includegraphics" later in this file.
\usepackage{graphicx}

%******** subfigure *****************************
% The subfigure package allows you to include multiple figures and
% captions within a single figure environment.
%\usepackage{subfigure}

%******** here **********************************
% The here package gives you more control over the placement of
% figures and tables.  In particular, you can specify the placement
% "H" which means "Put the figure here" rather than [h] which means
% "I would suggest that you put the figure here if you think it looks
% good."
%\usepackage{here}

%******** pdflscape ********************************
% This allows you to include landscape layout pages by using the
% |landscape| environment.  The use of |pdflscape| is preferred over
% the standard |lscape| package because it automatically rotates the
% page in the pdf file for easier reading.  (Thanks to Joseph Shea
% for pointing this out.)
\usepackage{pdflscape}

%******** natbib ********************************
% This is a very nice package for bibliographies.  It includes options
% for sorting and compressing bibliographic entries.
% \usepackage[numbers,sort&compress]{natbib}

\usepackage[backend=biber, style=ieee, doi=true, url=false]{biblatex}
\addbibresource{bibliography.bib}


%******** psfrag ******************************
% This allows you to replace text in postscript pictures with formated
% latex text.  This allows you to use math in graph labels
% etc. Uncomment the psfrag lines following the "%psfrag" comment
% later in this file if you don't have this package.  The replacements
% will only be visible in the final postscript file: they will be
% listed in the .dvi file but not performed.
\usepackage{psfrag}

%******** hyperref *****************************
% Please read the manual:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/hyperref/manual.html
%
% This adds hyperlinks to your document: with the right viewers (later
% versions of xdvi, acrobat with pdftex, latex2html etc.) this will
% make your equation, figure, citation references etc. hyperlinks so
% that you can click on them.  Also, your table of contents will be
% able to take you to the appropriate sections.  In the viewers that
% support this, the links often appear with an underscore.  This
% underscore will not appear in printed versions.
%
% Note: if you do not use the hypertex option, then the dvips driver
% may be loaded by default.  This will cause the entries in the list
% of figures and list of tables to be on a single line because dvips
% does not deal with hyperlinks on broken lines properly.
%
% NOTE: HYPERREF is sensitive to the ORDER in which it is LOADED.
% For example, it must be loaded AFTER natbib but BEFORE newly
% defined float environments.  See the README file with the hyperref
% for some help with this.  If you have some very obscure errors, try
% first disabling hyperref.  If that fixes the problem, try various
% orderings.
%
% Note also that there is a bug with versions before 2003/11/30
% v6.74m that cause the float package to not function correctly.
% Please ensure you have a current version of this package.  A
% warning will be issued if you leave the date below but do not have
% a current version installed.
%
% Some notes on options: depending on how you build your files, you
% may need to choose the appropriate option (such as [pdftex]) for the
% backend driver (see the hyperref manual for a complete list).  Also,
% the default here is to make links from the page numbers in the table
% of contents and lists of figures etc.  There are other options:
% excluding the [linktocpage] option will make the entire text a
% hyperref, but for some backends will prevent the text from wrapping
% which can look terrible.  There is a [breaklinks=true] option that
% will be set if the backend supports (dvipdfm for example supports
% it but does not work with psfrag.)
%
% Finally, there are many options for choosing the colours of the
% links.  These will be included by default in future versions but
% you should probably consider changing some now for the electronic
% version of your thesis.

The Kondo effect, first discovered in impure bulk metals during the 1930s and explained in the 1960s, has gained significant interest within the field of quantum devices. 
These devices offer a high degree of tunability and control, enabling rigorous testing of theoretical predictions.
Previous studies on the Kondo effect have measured conductance through a quantum dot and observed a zero-bias peak between Coulomb peaks. 
This effect requires strong coupling between the quantum dot and leads.

This work studies a relatively weak coupling, where the characteristic zero-bias peak between Coulomb peaks is not observed. However, as charge degeneracy of the quantum dot is approached, the Kondo temperature increases. This results in a small conductance enhancement at the shoulder of the Coulomb peak. 
We show that a simultaneous measurement of the quantum dot's occupation can unveil the small enhancement of conductance due to the Kondo effect. 

To compare with Numerical Renormalisation Group (NRG) theory, conductance and occupation are measured across a range of temperatures to determine fitting parameters.
Good agreement is found at a range of coupling strengths and charge sensor current setpoints.
However, a discrepancy is found when the tunnel barriers to the quantum dot are asymmetrically tuned. 

% Measurements of conductance and occupation across a range of temperatures allow for the determination of relevant parameters for comparison to Numerical Renormalisation Group (NRG) theory calculations. 



Strong asymmetric coupling approaches a regime where the quantum dot is coupled to a single lead. 
A recent measurement of the entropy of a quantum dot coupled to a single lead where Kondo correlations were expected also observed a discrepancy between data and NRG. 
Interestingly, this work shows that conductance data displays greater Kondo enhancement than NRG, whereas previously measured entropy showed less Kondo enhancement than NRG. 
A direct comparison of conductance and entropy measured in the same device under similar settings holds promise for illuminating this discrepancy.






  
\end{abstract}

\chapter{Lay Summary} %% Mandatory -  maximum 150 words

 The Kondo effect, a phenomenon originally observed in impure metals decades ago, has been studied more recently in quantum devices. 
 These devices offer precise control to test theoretical predictions. 
 In these devices, a single electron on an isolated island is connected to a bath of electrons on each side.
 
 Previous studies have measured the conductance through the island as a single electron is added and observed a large increase in conductance as the system's temperature was lowered. 
 These experiments used a small barrier between the island and surrounding electrons. 

 
 In our experiment, we used a large barrier, resulting in an increase in conductance that was too small to measure with previous methods.
 To measure this small increase in conductance, we also measure the island's occupation as a single electron is added. 
 When the barriers to the island are even, we find agreement with theory, and surprising disagreement when uneven. 



\chapter{Preface} % Manditory if any of the conditions are met

This thesis encompasses the research I conducted during my Master's studies in the Quantum Devices group, led by Joshua Folk, at the University of British Columbia. 

Numerous discussions with my supervisor Joshua Folk, and research associate Silvia Lüscher have greatly influenced the experimental concept, device design, and analysis interpretation. 

The GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructures were provided by Michael Manfra's group at the University of Purdue.
Christian Olsen fabricated the mesas and ohmic contacts at the University of Copenhagen.


Numerical Renormalisation Group (NRG) simulations that we compare our measurements to in Chapter~\ref{cha:mixed_valence_conductance}, were calculated by Yaakov Kleeorin, under the supervision of Yigal Meir.


I joined the Quantum Devices group as an undergraduate (September 2021) and spent the first eight months shadowing Timothy Child throughout the design, fabrication, measurement, and analysis processes.

The following year (first year of my Master's, September 2022), I spent working closely with Timothy on device design, fabrication, and measurement. Timothy and I fabricated all devices used in this thesis during this period. All data taken in Chapter~\ref{cha:device_background} and Chapter~\ref{cha:kondo_conductance} was taken by Timothy and I. In particular, at the end of this period, Timothy and I took preliminary measurements in the regime explored in Chapter~\ref{cha:mixed_valence_conductance}. These measurements demonstrated a working proof of how to measure in this regime. 

In my final year (starting May 2023), Timothy worked on his PhD, and I became the lead researcher responsible for data collection and analysis.
All data taken in Chapter~\ref{cha:mixed_valence_conductance} was taken during this period.  

All figures in this work are original.

% \section{Programs}
% Here we give an example of a new float as defined using the
% \texttt{float} package.  In the preamble we have used the commands
% \begin{verbatim}
% \floatstyle{ruled}
% \newfloat{Program}{htbp}{lop}[chapter]
% \end{verbatim}
% This creates a ``Program'' environment that may be used for program
% fragments.  A sample \texttt{python} program is shown in
% Program~\ref{prog:fib}.  (Note that Python places a fairly restrictive
% limit on recursion so trying to call this with a large $n$ before
% building up the cache is likely to fail unless you increase the
% recursion depth.)
% \begin{Program}
%   \caption{\label{prog:fib} Python program that computes the $n^{\rm
%       th}$ Fibonacci number using memoization.}
% \begin{verbatim}
% def fib(n,_cache={}):
%     if n < 2:
%         return 1
%     if n in _cache:
%         return _cache[n]
%     else:
%         result = fib(n-1)+fib(n-2)
%         _cache[n] = result
%         return result
% \end{verbatim}
% \end{Program}
% Instead of using a \texttt{verbatim} environment for your program
% chunks, you might like to \texttt{include} them within an
% \texttt{alltt} envrironment by including the \verb|\usepackage{alltt}|
% package (see page 187 of the \LaTeX{} book).  Another useful package
% is the \verb|\usepackage{listings}| which can pretty-print many

% \verb|\renewcommand{\appendicesname}{Appendix}| before calling
% \verb|\appendix| to display the singular ``Appendix'' rather than the

% \chapter{Second Appendix}
% Here is the second appendix.

%% This changes the headings and chapter titles (no numbers for
