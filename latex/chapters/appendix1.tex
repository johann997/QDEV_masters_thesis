    (\textbf{a}) GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructure is cleaned in an Ultra-Sonic (US) bath with acetone/IPA/DI. 
    (\textbf{b}) Two different layers of PMMA are spun ontop of the heterostructure.
    (\textbf{c}) The gate design is exposed to an electron beam to breakup the PMMA.
    (\textbf{d}) The chip is developed in an IPA:DI solution create an undercut and remove the exposed PMMA.
    (\textbf{e}) 2:\qty{12}{nm} of Ti:Au are evaporated ontop of the chip.
    (\textbf{f}) The chip is rinsed in acetone to remove remaining PMMA and any metal attached to it. The chip is ready to be placed onto a chip carrier, wirebonded and measured.}
